# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Audit Logging and Authentication System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create comprehensive audit logging for all sign/verify operations with PostgreSQL persistence and simple username/password authentication
# Details:
Implement AuditLogService that captures all sign/verify operations using JPA entities to persist to PostgreSQL audit_log table. Log operation type, image hash (SHA-256), algorithm used, timestamp, user_id, and operation result. Create simple authentication system with username/password (sufficient for localhost). Add logging interceptors to capture operation details. Implement Spring Security for basic authentication. Create audit log query API with JPA-based filtering and pagination. Use UUID for primary keys.

# Test Strategy:
Verify audit entries are created for every operation, test query functionality and filtering, check database persistence. Test authentication functionality and protected endpoints.

# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Image Signature Verification System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Create verification functionality for both embedded and detached signatures with comprehensive validation
# Details:
Implement ImageVerificationService that validates embedded signatures in PNG/JPEG metadata and detached .sig files. Extract signature data, verify against image content using SHA-256 hash, validate timestamp and key validity periods. Return verification result with signer key ID, algorithm, timestamp, and validity status (valid/invalid with reason).

# Test Strategy:
Test verification of signed images, tampered images, expired signatures, and invalid signatures. Verify both embedded and detached signature validation

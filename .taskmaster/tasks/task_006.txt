# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Detached Signature Generation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create functionality to generate detached .sig files containing image signatures
# Details:
Implement DetachedSignatureService that generates .sig files containing: original filename, image hash (SHA-256), algorithm used, timestamp (UTC), key ID, and signature bytes. Use structured format (JSON or custom binary) for .sig file content. Ensure .sig files can be associated with their corresponding images.

# Test Strategy:
Generate .sig files for test images, verify content structure and signature validation against original images
